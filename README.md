## Use your microscope for microfabrication!
Microscope with DMD projector is used to cure 3D printing resing. Based on uManager so many hardware devices are compatible.
Using the X/Y stage of the microscope, large structures can be printed while maintaining high spatial resolution.
`fabscope_notebook.py` offers a simple-to-use notebook, with step-by-step instructions to set up and calibrate the hardware.
